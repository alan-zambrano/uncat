look into unit testing, find which tester is best
find out how to save the tree without constructing it every time
create a makefile

n-ary tree
+is able to stop early (more efficient for longer words)
*worst case O(n*|n|), best case O(|n|) (|n| is the length of the longest word)
	|n| << n

Hash table
+O(1) finds
-O(n) space
